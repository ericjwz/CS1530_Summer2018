  * Online essays/articles will also be assigned.

This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software engineering. It will cover both theory and practical skills in software engineering necessary to be successful in industry. To that end, it will cover project and product management, software architecture and design patterns, team communications, and other material relevant to __engineering__ software instead of just __coding__ it.

## Grading

  * Group Project - 70%
    * Sprint 1 Deliverable - 10%
    * Sprint 2 Deliverable - 10%
    * Sprint 3 Deliverable - 15%
    * Sprint 4 Deliverable - 15%
    * Sprint 5 Deliverable - 20%
  * Reading Quizzes - 30%
    * There are 6 quizzes, with the lowest quiz score being dropped - thus each quiz counts for 6% (30 / 5) of your grade

Although lecture attendance is not mandatory (except for quiz days), it is strongly recommended that you come to class each for each lecture.  Material may be presented or covered in class that is not in the reading.

The syllabus is subject to modification if circumstances dictate (e.g. a guest lecturer is unable to make the scheduled day).

The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-93.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
92.99-90.00  | A-
89.99-87.00  | B+
86.99-83.00  | B
82.99-80.00  | B-
79.99-77.00  | C+
76.99-73.00  | C
72.99-70.00  | C-
69.99-67.00  | D+
66.99-63.00  | D
62.99-60.00  | D-
59.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project.  Projects may be analyzed with the Stanford _moss_ system to detect unauthorized collaboration between groups.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.

## Readings

Readings are listed in the _syllabus.md_ file for each day.  The instructor may not mention the reading for the next class.  The onus is on you to review the syllabus and do the appropriate reading before class.

## Attendance

Presence for the quizzes are REQUIRED.  As the lowest score is dropped, this is an automatic "free missed quiz".  Students do not get more than one missed quiz unless there is a documented emergency.

## Group Project Details

Students will be grouped into teams of approximately 4, and will work on a specified project for much of the course.  There will be several sprints, at the end of each of which the students will have a working version of their software available on GitHub, as well as documentation and other information (specified for each particular sprint).

Deliverables must be committed to GitHub by the beginning of class on the day that it is due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted unless authorized __at least 24 hours before the due date__.

All work will be done on GitHub - please make sure that you have an account which can create private repositories.  If you do not have this, you can get this with the GitHub education pack for free - please make sure you sign up with your pitt.edu address.  You can double-check by trying to create a private repository (by going to your profile page, clicking the Repositories tab, clicking the green "New" button, then at the bottom of that page, switching the radio button to make a private repository).  If you can't do it, please make sure you sign up for the free education pack to gain this ability - https://education.github.com/pack.  You'll also get some neat additional benefits such as fifty dollars in DigitalOcean credit and a free .me domain name.

## Programming Language Selection

All software projects for this course will be written in the Java language (version 1.8 or later).  Additionally, we will be using associated tools, libraries and frameworks such as Swing, Gradle and JUnit.  These will be discussed in class.

## Collaborative Programming

Note that all works produced by you are your intellectual property and you may do what you want with it.  However, this class is collaborative.  You may need to show and share your work to other students under the direction of the instructor.

You may discuss your project with members of other groups or the outside community.  That being said, these discussions should be general - having a friend write your code for you is considered academic dishonesty.  Asking how an algorithm would work, posting on Stack Overflow to figure out why a particular program won't install on your system, Googling for syntax, etc. are not considered academic dishonesty.  In general, if you are not showing anybody else your code, you are in the clear; if you are showing other people your code or others are writing it for you, you are committing an academic integrity violation.  If you have any questions about what you are doing might violate academic integrity guidelines, please feel free to discuss with me.

## Participating in Class

Under reasonable circumstances, it is almost always better to participate in class than not.  Questions and comments are invited and strongly encouraged!  However, this implies raising your hand and waiting to be called upon.  In dire circumstances, some waving of the hands in order to get the instructor's attention is allowed, but suboptimal.  Talking out of turn or while the instructor is speaking is generally frowned upon.  If it persists after a warning has been given, the instructor may ask any offending parties to leave the room to continue their discussion elsewhere.

## Disability Services Statement

The Office of Disability Resources and Services (DRS) provides a broad range of support services to assist students with disabilities. Services include, but are not limited to, tape-recorded textbooks, sign language interpreters, adaptive and transportation. Contact DRS at 412-648-7890 or 412-383-1355 (TTY) in 216 William Pitt Union or see www.drs.pitt.edu for more computer technology, Braille translation, and nonstandard exam arrangements, DRS can also assist students with accessibility to campus housing information.

## Academic Integrity Statement

The integrity of the academic process requires fair and impartial evaluation on the part of faculty and honest academic conduct on the part of students. To this end, students are expected to conduct themselves at a high level of responsibility in the fulfillment of the course of their study. It is the corresponding responsibility of faculty to make clear to students those standards by which students will be evaluated and the resources permissible for use by students during the course of their study and evaluation. The educational process is perceived as a joint faculty-student enterprise which will perforce involve professional judgment by faculty and may involve—without penalty—reasoned exception by students to the data or views offered by faculty.

Cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February 1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz or exam will be imposed.
