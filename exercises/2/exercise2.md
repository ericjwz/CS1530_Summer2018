## Exercise 2 - Git 911!

You have so far been using a very simple subset of all of the git commands.  From here on out, you will need to learn new techniques, as you will need to do more complicated operations.  Sometimes, other people in your group will also cause problems and you will have to work around them.  And many times, you will have to research the problem!

You and a partner should fork the BadRepo[0-4] repositories under GitHub username laboon.

BadRepo0 - Create a branch that corrects the incorrect text in the README.md file, then merge that back in the master branch.  Do not do the work directly on the master branch!  Corrections to be made: CS1530 should be the "best" class, not the "worst"; the line referencing pudding should be deleted; you should add a line at the end that says "Final version".

BadRepo1 - Somebody accidentally sent a commit which deleted all of the code.  Fix this so that the master branch has all of the code back.

BadRepo2 - Somebody merged a branch, but was in a real hurry and didn't check if it compiled.  Recover from this while still ensuring that their changes get merged in (that is, you don't just revert to the previous version).

BadRepo3 - Somebody created a branch with oh-so-many commits.  Compress them all down into one commit.

BadRepo4 - Merge the wjl_derp branch into master. Deal with the merge conflicts as best you can to eliminate them.  There should be no merge conflicts for full credit.

Please _show_ me the fixed repos to verify that you did everything correctly!  I will place answers up after class.

## Grading

This is an exercise and thus not graded.
